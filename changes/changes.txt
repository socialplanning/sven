 * Added sven.exc.MissingRepository exception, to be thrown when accessing a nonexistent repo.

 * Added kwarg `check_repo` to BzrAccess.__init__ with default `False`.  If set to True,
   the constructor will check for the existence of a repository and throw a MissingRepository
   if it does not exist.

 * Add `author` kwarg to BzrAccess.write with default `None`.  It can be set to a string value
   which will be used as the "author" of the commit.  (The system-level `bzr whoami` output 
   will still be used for the separate "contributor" of the commit.)  This is equivalent to the
   command-line `bzr commit --author`.

 * Add `timestamp` kwarg to BzrAccess.write with default `None`.  It can be set to a numerical
   timestamp, which will override the current system time in the commit.  This is equivalent to
   the command-line `bzr commit --timestamp`.

 * Manually strip all "\r" characters from the commit message; bzr seems to break if any are 
   present.
